## Overview

* What's Composer?
  * is a tool for dependency management in PHP.
  * is not a package manager in the same sense as Yum or Apt are.
  * manages packages on a per-project basis.
  * installs packages in a directory (e.g. vendor) inside your project.

Note:

What does this mean?
* Scope is per-project, not global
* Resolves dependencies
* Runs installation tasks
